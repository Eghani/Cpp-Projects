# C++ Projects by Ehteshamul Ghani (Kabir)

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository of Level 1 C++ projects. Here, you'll find practical projects that demonstrate fundamental concepts of C++ programming.

## Projects Included
1. **Simple Calculator**
   - Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).

2. **BMI Calculator**
   - Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and weight.
   
3. **Grade Calculator**
   - Compute average marks, percentage, and assign grades based on the percentage obtained.
   
4. **Currency Converter**
   - Convert Indian Rupees to the currency of various countries based on predefined rates.
   
5. **Temperature Converter**
   - Convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.

6. **Percentage Calculator**
   - Calculate percentage based on given values (e.g., percentage of total marks).

7. **Hypotenuse Calculator**
   - Calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle given the lengths of the other two sides.

8. **Functions in C++**
   - Demonstrate the use of functions in C++ for modular code and code reusability.

9. **Simple Interest Calculator**
   - Calculate simple interest based on principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

10. **Find Maximum Number**
    - Find the maximum number from a set of numbers entered by the user.

## Getting Started
To run these projects, make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. You can compile and run each project individually using commands like `g++` for compiling and then executing the resulting binary.

### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming language

## Usage
Each project is contained in its own directory. Navigate to the project directory and compile the source file (`*.cpp`) using a C++ compiler. Run the compiled executable to interact with the project.

Example:
```bash
cd SimpleCalculator
g++ -o main SimpleCalculator.cpp
./main
